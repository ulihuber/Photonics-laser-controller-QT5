This is a controller for the headless laser unit Photonics DP20 DPSS. 
As a Python/QT5 program, PHQT1.py should run fine on most platforms with minimal changes.
For testing purposes, I added a responder application. This emulates a real laser in it's communication logic.
You need a second com port and a cross cable ( pins 2-3, 3-2 and 5-5 on the subD9 connector).

As lasers present a danger to health or even life, I reject any responsability for it's operation.
See it as a starting point for further development. Whatever you do, you do it on your own risk.
