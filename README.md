This is a controller for the headless laser unit Photonics DP20 DPSS
As a Python/QT5 Program it should be running on most platforms with minimal changes.
For testing purpose, I added a responder application. This needs a second com port and a cross cable.
( pins 2-3, 3-2 and 5-5 on the subD9 connector)

As lasers present a danger to health or even life, I reject any responsability for it's operation.
See it as a starting point for further development. Whatever you do, you do it on your own risk.
